# YABDL
Yet Another Booru DownLoader

Status : Not functionnal... Yet :^)

# About this project :

This is intended to be a tool to download pictures with batch actions that I will personnally use.
This isn't intended to better than any other tool, especially your nice scripts that already does the job.

This is intended to be crossplatform between GNU/Linux and Windows.
This isn't intended to be supported on Mac for few reasons :
 - I don't own a Mac 
 - I don't support Apple in any way and will probably never
 - I don't understand why people who run MacOS would go further than running itunes and browsing facebook.

This is intended to be a project where I can learn, because we never stop learning (here basically GTK# and crossplatforming with C#).
This isn't intended to be a professionnal app with active support, if you get a bug and I'm too busy to fix it, fix it yourself (I'm usually reactive about them tho).

 - Personnal reasons

Will X functionnality be implemented ?
 - You can check the todolist here : https://github.com/AniDevTwitter/YABDL/blob/master/YABDL/TODO.txt,
 - If it's not in it just ask me, I'll probably add it

Why C# ?
 - The language is quite fitting for these kind of tasks, aka a basic app without complex system related code and performance related issues
 - Personnal preference

Why GTK# ?
 - It's a well made cross platform GUI framework for C# that avoid writing style related stuff (using system style)
 - Wanted to learn it to have atleast one GUI framework to work on GNU/Linux systems
